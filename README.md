## What is ASP.NET Core Web API?

ASP.NET Core Web API is a framework designed to help developers create powerful and efficient RESTful Web Services (APIs) using the ASP.NET Core platform. These APIs act as bridges between different types of applications, such as web apps, mobile apps, desktop software, and external services.

## Key Features:

1. **Controller-Based Approach:**
   - In ASP.NET Core Web API, controllers are central. They are classes derived from `ControllerBase`.
   - Controllers manage incoming requests to the API and generate appropriate responses.
   - Each request triggers the creation and disposal of a controller instance.

2. **Routing and Endpoints:**
   - This framework uses attribute-based routing.
   - Developers can define routes directly on controller actions using attributes like `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, etc.
   - Endpoints map incoming requests to specific actions within controllers.

3. **Content Negotiation:**
   - Responses from the API can be in various formats such as JSON, XML, etc.
   - Content negotiation allows clients to specify their preferred format using the `Accept` header.
   - ASP.NET Core Web API handles the serialization of data based on the client's request.

4. **Dependency Injection (DI):**
   - ASP.NET Core encourages the use of DI for better code maintenance and testing.
   - Services can be injected into controllers, filters, and other parts of the application.
   - DI fosters a flexible and modular design by reducing the coupling between components.

5. **Middleware Pipeline:**
   - The request pipeline in ASP.NET Core Web API is made up of middleware components.
   - Middleware handles tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.
   - Developers have the flexibility to customize this pipeline to fit their application's specific requirements.

## Getting Started:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - To begin, you can use Visual Studio 2022 with the ASP.NET and web development features.
   - Alternatively, you can follow instructions using Visual Studio Code and the .NET CLI on macOS, Linux, or Windows.
   - Make sure you have the .NET 8.0 (Long Term Support) framework installed.

2. **Create a Web Project:**
   - In Visual Studio, go to File > New > Project.
   - Search for "Web API" and choose the ASP.NET Core Web API template.
   - Name your project (e.g., "TodoApi") and configure the settings.
   - Opt to include OpenAPI support for automatic API documentation.

3. **Add a NuGet Package:**
   - Use the NuGet Package Manager to add `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`.
   - This package supports an in-memory database for this tutorial.

4. **Build Your API:**
   - Define your controllers, routes, and data models.
   - Implement CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for your resources.
   - Utilize Entity Framework Core for handling data access.
